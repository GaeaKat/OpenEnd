CLAY

With some help from the giants, we've learned that their feet are able to endure hardness, but they are hurt by water! The same thing we need to live, in our world. It almost made us laugh when we saw how they cowered from it after the first one touched the water.

Of course, we have no intention of hurting them. We learned that clay is soft enough, and by forming a bowl of clay around one side of an emerald, the child was able to hold it. It was so adorable how his purple eyes sparkled as he finally held the beautiful stone he admired.

He then offered the emerald to my child, who played with it. A ball of clay allowed them to play catch! I watched them play catch all afternoon...
