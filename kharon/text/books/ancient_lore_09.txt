ENVOYS

The giants visit regularly. They are weak compared to us. They can lift only lightweight objects and materials. I notice this more clearly for having lived among them so long.

My people can move stones and find metal. They have the ability to work gems that the giants cannot lift. For that, however, there is one thing that my people cannot do. We cannot open the gate to Elysium.

However, I have negotiated with the giants and they have allowed us to enter their world. To teach them what we can and make the gates more stable. The stone of their world has an effect on the gates, causing them to shimmer even when they are closed, but only if the gate is surrounded...

At any time, a few or our miners are allowed to bring small amounts of their stone to the stronghold, and never to bring it outside of the stronghold.
