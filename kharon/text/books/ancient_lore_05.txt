As we entered this 
paradise, the first
thing I noticed was
the beautiful, per-
fectly green grass.
This grass was un-
like anything in
our world.

After the grass, I
noticed the pillars
-->>
that held the firm-
ament above us.
Stark white pillars
of a stone not
found anywhere we
knew of.

In this world we
saw the giants in
their true nature.
Peaceful and wise,
with a mouth they 
never opened. They
-->>
spoke only into the
soul. They never
ate, and we soon
realized that we
had no more hunger
and no more need to
eat.

The pillars gave a
powerful blessing 
to the giants, and 
to us. Within their
influence, living 
-->>
creatures appeared 
to never age, and 
were immune to the 
ravages of hunger 
and thirst. Though
we lacked the spir-
itual gifts of the
giants, we now
found that we were
like them, so long
as we lived in
Elysium.
