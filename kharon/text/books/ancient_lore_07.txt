STRONGHOLD
Ancient Chronicler

The people had developed significant wisdom and knowledge in our absence. They now grew more crops, and fenced in the wild animals. they had even learned how to return stone to its natural state after breaking it from the earth!

With this knowledge, and the guarantee that our lives had been prolonged rather than cut short, the people sent an envoy with us. Three masons and two engineers would secure the room with the gate. With this room, we could return and know the dead and the monsters were no longer a threat to us.

The masons had already begun their work with furnaces when the giant came to bring us home -- for Elysium is now our home.
