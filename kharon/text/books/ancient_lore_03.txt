Missing Gate
Ancient Chronicler
STRONGHOLD,DUNGEON

By a miracle, we
found our way to
the cavern of the
gate. Carved into
the stone walls
were messages that
promised us that
this is the place.

Yet the gate is
gone!

So too is our food.

We may starve here.
I have proposed we
wait a day, then
turn back. If we
become desparate,

No, I will not hold
that thought. The
gate is here, and I
will die waiting to
go through it
before I turn back.
