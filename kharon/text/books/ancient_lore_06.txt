MORTALITY
Ancient Chronicler
STRONGHOLD,DUNGEON

Though we ceased to
age, we are not
immortal. The
oldest of us died
yesterday. The
giants asked us
to return him to
our home, though
they provided us
with a box in
which to bear him
there.

When we returned,
the cavern seemed
larger and more
regular. This
appeared to be
the result of our
kin. We now had a
natural sense,
though, of these
caves, perhaps a
gift from the
giants. We bore
the box to the
-->>
surface, where we
met a band of
seekers like
ourselves, yet we
learned an
amazing thing...

We have been gone
for two whole
lifetimes. Our
childrens'
children were the
ones to greet us
-->>
at the surface,
and our
disappearance had
caused the people
to stop seeking
the gate we had
found. We shall
remain here for a
day or two before 
we return.
