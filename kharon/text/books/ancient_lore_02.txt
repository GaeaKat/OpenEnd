Underworld
Ancient Chronicler
STRONGHOLD,DUNGEON

The underworld is
a dangerous place.
We have prepared as
many torches as we
could, and still
the trek is treach-
erous. A great
chasm opened before
us at one point,
and we scaled the
walls to the floor,
as the stories told
us was the way.

However we are now
lost. The mining
tunnels are a maze
for those of us who
are scholars, not
miners or soldiers.

I pray we will find
our way before our
food is exhausted.
