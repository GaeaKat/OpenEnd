BLESSING

As we entered this paradise, the first thing I noticed was the beautiful, perfectly green grass. This grass was unlike anything in our world. Then I noticed the pillars that held the firmament above Elysium. Stark white pillars of a stone not found anywhere we knew of.

In this world we saw the giants in their true nature. Peaceful and wise, with a mouth they never opened. They spoke only into the soul. They never ate, and we quickly realized that we had no more hunger and no more need to eat.

The pillars provided a powerful blessing to the giants, and to us. Within their influence, living creatures appeared never to age, and were immune to the ravages of hunger and thirst. Though we lacked the spiritual gifts of the giants, we now found that we were like them, so long as we lived in Elysium.
