BLACK STONE

The soul is sealed within a womb of black stone. It is held asleep by the pillars that hold the firmament, not by the black stone itself. But now I can speak to it.

It says that if the stone holding it is used to make pillars, just like the pillars holding the firmament now, it may be able to awaken.
