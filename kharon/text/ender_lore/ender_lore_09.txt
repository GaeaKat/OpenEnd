RING OF GLASS

We have constructed a ring of pillars around the heart of the world. As many as we could. But my followers begin to doubt.

Tonight I shall construct the final piece. The soul speaks plainly to me now, and guides my actions.

Tonight it shall awaken and cleanse this paradise of the outworlders!
