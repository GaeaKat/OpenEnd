BLACK GLASS

The mystics of the outsiders have identified this stone as black glass or obsidian.

They have said we can create it from the melted stone of their underworld, by cooling it suddenly with the accursed liquid that fills their world. I will negotiate a trading bargain with their home for as much of this black glass as possible.
