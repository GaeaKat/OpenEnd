CRYSTAL

A shimmering opal appeared in our mining of alabaster today. As I saw it I heard the soul whisper to me that this crystal would be necessary to ensure its awakening. This is not all we have discovered underground.

We have also found that there are great veins below the grass of a blue rugged stone. This stone is as durable as that used by the outsiders for their tools, where the cream colored stone we see most often is too weak for making reliable tools.
