PILLAR

We have used a great amount of black glass to construct a pillar, but we still need more. From the top of this pillar, however, I see the truth.

The white pillars do not hold up the firmament, but they bear a gleaming crystal, likely the same as the opals we've discovered so rarely. That crystal seems to provide that the outowlrders call "the blessing."

After setting the first opal opn this pillar, I feel the soul has grown stronger. It now speaks clearly to me even when I am on the surface, at least near the pillar.

It needs more pillars.
