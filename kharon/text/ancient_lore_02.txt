UNDERWORLD

The underworld is a dangerous place. We have prepared as many torches as we could, and still the trek is treacherous. A great chasm opened before us at one point, and we scaled the walls to the floor, as the stories told us was the way.

However we are now lost. The mining tunnel is a maze for those of us who are scholars, rather than miners or adventurers... I pray we will find our way before our food is exhausted.
