CHILDREN

The ancient sage has told us we may live in Elysium! Time seems so meaningless here, but the world is amazing. I know the sage told us long ago that we could live here, but as I said, time seems so meaningless here.

The giants are so friendly, too. They bring us food, though they do not eat, for many of us are accustomed to this action. Some of them investigate our houses through the windows. Why, just the other day, I saw one peeking in at me as I ate, and moving its arm as if to mimic me.

I soon noticed that this giant was shorter than the others. It was standing at its full height as it watched me, yet its eyes were squarely in my window.
