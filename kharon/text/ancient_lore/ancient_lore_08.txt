STRONGHOLD II

Our numbers are shrinking. Now only two of us remain. We have taken the latest of our dead back to the world of his birth. Our people have secured much more than merely the gate. They now have a stronghold in the heart of the underworld. In the lifetimes we have spent in Elysium, they have advanced beyond our knowledge.

In truth, mortal men are not suited to immortal lives.
