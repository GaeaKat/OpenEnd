FALL

I am amazed that my life yet continues. Every time I believe myself dead I awaken the next morning. I believe I am a new life. I am not a giant, but I am no longer what my kin are -- what their descendants have become.

I have visited places where I would swear I had died, and the world showed no sign of my presence. I live as I always have, though my body changes.

Today it has been an epoch since the fall of the strongholds. The refugees from Elysium were weak and needy. The ancients were weakened by their presence, though their charity is noble. I have come to know the Endermen.

Their masters, the Enders, sought a world purified. They got a world fallen. But the dragon can no more come here than we can go there. The third eyes were a gift of the giants -- the Endermen have no sense of compassion for those who gaze on them.

Yet I feel one Enderman follows me specially.

My soul stirs when he is in the corner of my gaze.

Is it my time?

Or does he know me?
