GENTLE GIANT

An elysian giant appeared before us "tonight." I say this because my companions were asleep until I roused them, for the sky is nowhere in sight. The giant spoke into my soul, into our souls, for it had no mouth we could see...

"Why do you seek Elysium?"

We sought peace, respite from our harsh lives. We told the giant, and it held its arm to the center of the cavern, where a blue glow began to appear.

"Leave your items here."

With trepidation, we left our remaining torches and the crude weapons we had brought for defense on the floor. The glow grew large enough for a man to walk through, and so my companions did. As I conclude this passage, I shall join them.
