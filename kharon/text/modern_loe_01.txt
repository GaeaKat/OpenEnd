STEVE

The Enderman was the giant I knew so long ago.

It showed me a soul shaped like mine.

The soul called itself STEVE.
The soul called itself HUMAN.

The soul sought to create and survive...
The soul could be cruel, but it could be kind as well.
It was a confusing soul...

But it lived despite all.

It would seek the places of its death...
Then it would continue where it had died

STEVE did not give up
And I found peace.

My ancient friend wrapped its arms around me.

And we left this world together...
Pausing only to let STEVE know:

The universe is a wondrous place.
