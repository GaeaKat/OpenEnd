SOFTNESS

The giant said the emerald is too sharp! Sharp? We talked about it more today, and that's not really the right word. It turns out that they have very sensitive skin, and it hurts for them to even touch things we would call "hard". Their souls, as they explain, are "cut" by such hard materials.

In fact, even the stone of the pillars, and the stone we mine through, are too hard for them. They are simply unable to do the work we do, even though their bodies are truly no weaker than ours -- they are just more sensitive!

The child loves the emerald, so I tried to imagine some way he could hold it without hurting himself, but so far, I can't think of anything that would make it softer.
