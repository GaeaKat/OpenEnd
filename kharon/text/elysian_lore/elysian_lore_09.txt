REFUGEE

I was the first to awaken, but as time passed, more and more of our kin returned from the gate. The eyes stabilizing it had vanished. Some arrived awake and chilled through. They claimed they had been in nothingness until the gate released them.

Some had not vanished when the dragon roared. They had been shielded by their children or grandchildren against the voice of the dragon and its edict. They said the giants were called Endermen, at least by the Enders who followed the dragon.

But the Enders never followed us back. They were satisfied to evict us, though the Endermen would come at night. My child was the last refugee. The parent of the first Ender was the last of our kin to return from the End world.

The stronghold, however, was useless. It could not sustain so many, though we had grown weak in our complacency while living in Elysium. We could no longer work the land as we once had, and were required to rely on the pity of our old kin.
