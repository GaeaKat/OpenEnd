SUNDERING

The sky vanished last night. As I watched the stars, I heard a roar, and then the stars were gone. The giants near me shuddered and convulsed. They became as dark as the sky, except for their eyes.

They are no longer friendly, though they seem to behave much as they ever have. They moved the dirt until the second roar came... then the dirt vanished. All of the things we had brought, except the black glass the enders have been gathering, did the same. Only the stone of Elysium remained.

And when dawn should have come, we saw a shadow crossing the dark, starless sky. It swept down and for an instant I saw its eyes. This was the god of this world, and it was angered. It roared, and then...

I knew no more until I awoke in the stronghold, though in my dreams I saw the world shrink into the black. Elysium was now at the end of its life, and the beast -- the dragon -- would conduct it the rest of the way.
