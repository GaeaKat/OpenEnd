FRIENDSHIP

The child has become a fast friend to my own child. They play every day. I also notice that the children seem to age as normal, though we were told we would not age in Elysium. How does the blessing know the difference between a child and an adult?

They do seem to grow up so quickly, though. Perhaps it has something to do with the difference in time? One of the mystics has said that every day here is like ten days back home. Is that why my child is growing up so quickly? Or is it a part of the blessing, perhaps?

Oh! We received a gift of emeralds from home yesterday. They're so pretty, and the giant child seems to love looking at them, though he can't pick even the smallest of them up. I wonder why it is that the giants can't pick up such simple things?
