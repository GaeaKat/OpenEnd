ENDER

After my grandchild was born, more unions came about. My child is the oldest of the "Enders" as they have come to call themselves. We are confused by the name, but they say it is what their souls tell them.

The Enders are much like us. My grandchild is roughly my height, but at times he has the purple eyes of a giant. He finds water repulsive, and refuses to tend the farms that we keep for celebrations. Yet he is as capable of handling "hard" objects as us.

The giants study the Enders as we do. Their souls, as the giants say, are distinct from both of their parents. Their abilities are not so unique as the shape of their souls. They have the third eye, but show no signs of blinking between locations as the giants.
