The Elysians have taught us of their gifts, that we may better understand these new "Enders".

Teleportation

Elysian giants have no need to walk, though they often do. They are able to vanish from one place and reappear in another, along with anything they are wearing or carrying.

Planeswalking

The Elysian giants can walk between the planes of the universe as easily as we can walk between two spaces. The shape of their soul, as they say, exists on a level beyond the shape of planes, while ours is bound to planes of existence as a letter is bound to a page.

Telepathy

The Elysians speak to the soul with a power they call "telepathy" which means they never need to open their mouths. In fact, they only ever open their mouths to cry out in pain, or to speak with beings which cannot be touched by telepathy.

Awareness

Elysian giants are aware when they are looked at. They explain that their soul feels the gaze of other souls as if they were being touched physically.
