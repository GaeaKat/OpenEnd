Hello everyone!

I am Kharon Alpua (Nathaniel Knight), from Michigan, and
I am modding with the New Gaea Modteam, composed of myself
and Nekosune.

Our mod is called Open End, and will add End Villages to the game,
along with some blocks appropriate for building these villages.

I am primarily responsible for the artistic assets such as block
textures. We will have a few other assets involved, but I'd like
to reveal those as we develop them instead of all up front.

For tools, I will be using the following:

	Eclipse (all code involved in my work)
	Blender (any models and testing of textures)
	Photoshop & Illustrator (texture work)
	Notepad++ (all raw text data, like this!)
	Audacity (if any audio is required)
	
I am streaming using OBS, with background music through foobar2000.
	If you have any questions about my setup or workflow, ask them
	in the twitch chat and I will do my best to respond in a timely
	manner.
	
Alright.
I'm back, and I hope this will be a bit less intensive on my processor.
So to start with, I need to refresh my dev with nekosune's work from earlier today.
