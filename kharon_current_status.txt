	12:49 - Fell asleep for much too long... eating something before I get
		back to work. Whould be back by 13:15-13:30 EST.
	13:13 - Back to work now!
	15:00 - Break needs to last until my pizzar delivery gets here, and the roads
	   are a bit bad. Will be back to work as soon as possible!
	Had to take day off to recover from fever. I hate getting sick.

	11:28 - Finally back to work again. Can't help yesterday's problem, just have to do best to finish up today.
	12:45 - I think I'm done with the textures, at least for now.
		Alabaster may get a pass to be a bit less blatanty tiled on the brown veins, but for right now I'm satisfied with the work I've gotten done.
	13:05 - Have to do some chores and make lunch. Will be back in 60 minutes at most.
	13:35 - Dishes done, so here's a summary of our goals:
		We're going to add Dark End Stone and possibly Alabasater to worldgen for the End dimension.
		We're going to add as quick of a solution for End Villages as we can: right now it looks like we're starting from the core village, and replacing the well with and Obsidian or Alabaster spire.
		Alabaster Villages will use regular End Stone for their buildings, while Obsidian Villages will use Dark End Stone.
		Right now, they should generate with Villagers, but we hope to replace this in later development with a new type of villager unique to The End.
		You will be able to summon more Ender Dragons through this new content, 
		We'll consider the project complete for Modjam (not 100% complete, but Modjam goal achieved) if we can get Alabaster Villages, Dark End Stone, and Alabaster added to the worldgen for The End, as well as the ability to trigger a second Ender Dragon.
	Our definite later goals:
		We want to add a veriety of lore in Fortresses and The End that explains our vision -- but this may not quite fit the normal minecraft feel. Adding lore books is a late goal.
		We would like to have Scorched Trees generate rarely in the landscape of The End -- and Scorched Saplings drop from their leaves.
		We may add some other features later on that we've only discussed a bit so far... among them, the option of two-way portals to and from The End. But those are post-jam goals, since we both still have our jobs at some point before the jam ends.
